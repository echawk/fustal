In no particular order:

- [ ] Setup Continuous Integration
- [x] Write SETUP.md under docs/
- [x] Write initial test suite infrastructure.
    - [ ] Integrate `test.R` & `test.py`
- [x] Decide on a License, likey MIT/ISC/BSD.
- [x] Setup a system for docs generation (Java Docs style?).
    - [ ] Eventually move to using Futhark's built in doc generator

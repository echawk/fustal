## Why? - In general

This is my capstone project for DATA Science at Valparaiso
University.

## Why? - Futhark

Futhark was chosen because it came up in summer research
that I did under Professor Nicholas Rosasco. Futhark was
also chosen because of it's very promising performance
benchmarks and the active academic research that goes
into it. Writing this statistical software package will
hopefully bring more attention to this very interesting
language.

It also helps that I really enjoy functional programming.

Futhark also compiles to multiple different backends,
including Python - so this can be used by more than
just myself.
